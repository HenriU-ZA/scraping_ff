# scraping_ff
Scraping fantastic fiction website for Author books, with release year, and synopsys.
I am then storing the data in a readable text file, that I can print, or use in different ways. 
Mostly created as my father in law likes to read, but can never figure out the order to read the books in, He likes reading in chronological order, so i just print these out for his favourite authors, and put it n a file for him.
